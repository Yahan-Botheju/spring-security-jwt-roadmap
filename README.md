<h1 align="center"> Spring Security With JWT Roadmap </h1>

---

This roadmap represents my learning journey with JWT authentication & Spring Security. 
I had already explored JWT, refresh token, token rotation & security concepts in Express.js. 
However, implementing the same concepts in Java Spring Boot using Clean Architecture gave me 
a depper understanding of how authentication & authorization work in enterprise applications.

Through these projects, I focused on understanding the complete security flows rather than 
just making it work. My goal is to keep learning & refining these concepts until I can confidently
design & implement secure applications from scratch. 

 - The Projects listed below showcases the step I followed while learning JWT & Spring Security,
For more details, refer to the README & projects repos.

<h2 align="center"> Project 01 - Stateless JWT Authentication API</h2>

---
### 📌 Overview

Stateless JWT Authentication API is a backend REST API project built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Spring Security**.  
The project demonstrates how to implement a secure authentication and authorization system using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** with a completely **stateless architecture**.

---
### 📊 Process

Stateless JWT authentication means the server does not store sessions. After login, it generates a signed JWT token and sends it to the client. The client stores the token and includes it in every request.
For each request, Spring Security extracts and validates the token, loads the user, and sets authentication if it is valid. Access is then controlled based on user roles like ADMIN or USER. After the request is completed, nothing is stored on the server. Every request is independent and must include a valid token.

---

The system manages:

- 👤 User Authentication
- 🔑 JWT Token Generation & Validation
- 🛡️ Role-Based Authorization
- 📋 Task Management
- 🗑️ Soft Delete Support
- 🧩 Clean Architecture Structure

The application follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- 🧠 Domain Layer

<h2 align="center"> Project 02 - Method-Level Security & Global Security Exceptions </h2>

---

 #### Project 02 is an enhancement of Project 01 rather than a completely new application.

The Clean Architecture structure, JWT authentication flow, and business domain remain the same.
This version introduces custom authentication exception handling to provide standardized JSON
responses for unauthorized requests and improve the overall security experience.


---

## 🚀 Project V2 Enhancements

### 🔥 What's New in Version 2

Version 2 introduces custom JWT authentication error handling and improved security exception responses.

The goal of this update is to provide consistent JSON error responses whenever a user attempts to access protected resources without a valid JWT token.

---

## 🔐 Custom JWT Authentication Entry Point

A new custom authentication entry point has been introduced:

```java
JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint
```

This component implements Spring Security's:

```java
AuthenticationEntryPoint
```

and is responsible for handling authentication failures before requests reach application controllers.

### ✨ Responsibilities

* Handles requests with missing, invalid, or expired JWT tokens
* Return a standardized JSON error response
* Prevent Spring Security from returning default HTML error pages

---

## 📦 Standardized Unauthorized Response

When authentication fails, the API now returns:

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing token, Access Denied",
  "path": "/requested-endpoint"
}
```

### Benefits

* Consistent API responses
* Better frontend integration
* Easier error handling for client applications
* Improved developer experience during debugging

---

## 🛡️ Security Configuration Enhancement

The Security Filter Chain has been updated with custom exception handling:

```java
.exceptionHandling(exception -> exception
        .authenticationEntryPoint(jwtAuthenticationEntryPoint)
)
```

### Purpose

This configuration instructs Spring Security to use the custom JWT authentication entry point whenever an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected endpoint.

Instead of returning Spring Security's default response, the application now returns a clean JSON error structure.

---

## 🔄 Authentication Failure Flow

```text
Client Request
      ↓
JWT Authentication Filter
      ↓
Authentication Failure
      ↓
Spring Security
      ↓
JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint
      ↓
Custom JSON Error Response
      ↓
HTTP 401 Unauthorized
```
---

     │    └── JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint.java      @Connect error handler
     └── ...

```
---

## 🎯 Security Improvements

### Before V2

* Default Spring Security authentication errors
* Inconsistent error responses
* Difficult frontend error parsing

### After V2

* Custom authentication exception handling
* Consistent JSON responses
* Better API consumer experience
* Cleaner security architecture
* Improved JWT authentication flow

---

## 📚 Spring Security Concepts Added

Version 2 introduces the following Spring Security concepts:

* AuthenticationEntryPoint
* Custom Security Exception Handling
* JWT Authentication Error Responses
* Unauthorized Request Processing
* Centralized Authentication Failure Management

---

## ⭐ Project Evolution

### Version 1

* JWT Authentication
* JWT Authorization
* Stateless Security
* Role-Based Access Control
* User & Task Management

### Version 2

* All Version 1 Features
* Custom AuthenticationEntryPoint
* Centralized Authentication Failure Handling
* Standardized JSON Error Responses
* Improved API Error Consistency
* Better Frontend Integration
* Enhanced Security Experience

---
## 🎯 Why This Upgrade Matters

In real-world REST APIs, clients expect predictable JSON responses. Without a custom AuthenticationEntryPoint, Spring Security may return default authentication responses that are harder for frontend applications to process.

By introducing a centralized JWT authentication error handler, the API now provides clean, consistent, and client-friendly responses whenever authentication fails.

---

<h2 align="center">Project-03 Cookie Based JWT Auth</h2>

---

## 📌 Overview

Project 03 extends the previous Stateless JWT Authentication implementation by introducing **Cookie-Based Authentication** using **HttpOnly Cookies**.

In Project 01, JWT tokens were stored on the client side and sent through the `Authorization` header for every request. While this approach is commonly used, modern applications often store access tokens inside secure cookies to reduce exposure to client-side JavaScript.

This project demonstrates how to integrate JWT authentication with Spring Security while storing authentication tokens inside **HttpOnly Cookies**, allowing the browser to automatically send tokens with requests.

The project continues to follow **Clean Architecture** principles and maintains a completely **stateless authentication flow**.

---

## 🚀 Project V3 Enhancements

### 🔥 What's New in Version 3

Version 3 introduces Cookie-Based JWT Authentication.

Instead of sending JWT tokens through the Authorization header, tokens are now stored inside secure cookies and automatically included in requests by the browser.

---

## 📊 Authentication Flow

Cookie-based JWT authentication remains stateless.

After a user successfully registers or logs in:

1. A JWT token is generated.
2. The token is stored inside an HttpOnly cookie.
3. The browser automatically sends the cookie with every request.
4. Spring Security extracts the token from the cookie.
5. The JWT is validated.
6. The user is authenticated.
7. Access is granted to protected resources.

---

### 🔄 Cookie-Based Authentication Flow

```text
User Login / Register
        ↓
Generate JWT Token
        ↓
Store JWT in HttpOnly Cookie
        ↓
Browser Automatically Sends Cookie
        ↓
JwtAuthenticationFilter
        ↓
Extract Token From Cookie
        ↓
Validate JWT
        ↓
Authenticate User
        ↓
Access Protected Resources
```

---

## 🍪 HttpOnly Cookie Implementation

A dedicated cookie provider was introduced to manage authentication cookies.

### Responsibilities

* Create authentication cookies
* Read authentication cookies
* Remove authentication cookies during logout
* Extract JWT token from incoming requests

---

## 🔐 Cookie Security Features

The authentication cookie is configured with:

```text
🔐 Cookie Security Features
The authentication cookie is configured with:

- HttpOnly = true (Prevents JavaScript access to JWT tokens, mitigating XSS risks)
- SameSite = Strict (Provides top-tier protection from Cross-Site Request Forgery - CSRF)
- Path = / (Accessible throughout all application context paths)
- MaxAge = 24 Hours
- Secure = false (Set to false for easy Local Development environment validation. Must be set to true in Production environments requiring SSL/TLS).
```

### Benefits

* Prevents JavaScript access to JWT tokens
* Reduces XSS attack risks
* Browser automatically handles token transmission
* No need to manually attach Authorization headers
* Maintains stateless authentication

---

## 🎯 Security Improvements

### Before - project 01 and 02

* JWT stored on client side
* Client manually sends Authorization header
* Token accessible depending on storage mechanism

### After - project 03

* JWT stored inside HttpOnly Cookie
* Browser automatically sends cookie
* JavaScript cannot directly access token
* Improved protection against XSS attacks
* Cleaner authentication workflow

---

## 📚 Spring Security Concepts Added

Project 3 introduces:

* Cookie-Based JWT Authentication
* HttpOnly Cookies
* SameSite Cookie Protection
* Custom Token Extraction
* Cookie Management Services
* Stateless Authentication with Cookies

---

## ⭐ Project Evolution

### Version 1

* Stateless JWT Authentication
* Spring Security
* Role-Based Authorization
* Clean Architecture

### Version 2

* Custom AuthenticationEntryPoint
* Standardized Security Error Responses
* Centralized Authentication Handling

### Version 3

* Cookie-Based JWT Authentication
* HttpOnly Cookie Storage
* Automatic Browser Authentication
* Secure Token Management
* User Notes Module

---

## 🎯 Why This Upgrade Matters

Many modern web applications use cookies instead of browser storage for authentication tokens.

By introducing HttpOnly cookies, authentication becomes more secure while maintaining a stateless architecture.

This project demonstrates how JWT authentication and Spring Security can be combined with secure cookie handling to create a more production-oriented authentication flow.

---

### ⭐ Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, the following concepts were practiced:

* Cookie-Based Authentication
* HttpOnly Cookies
* Secure JWT Storage
* Cookie Security Attributes
* Spring Security Cookie Authentication
* Stateless Security with Cookies
* Custom Token Extraction
* User Ownership Validation
* Note Management APIs
* Clean Architecture Enhancements
